# Machine for Python

Machine is a natural language processing library. It is specifically focused on providing tools and techniques that are useful for processing languages that are very resource-poor. The library is also useful as a foundation for building more advanced language processing techniques. The library currently only provides a basic set of algorithms, but the goal is to include many more in the future.

## Installation

Machine is available as a pip package:

```
pip install sil-machine
```
