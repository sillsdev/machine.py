    <verse number="18" style="v" />This is <char style="add">the account of what happened just before</char> Jesus Christ was born. Mary, his mother, {had publicly promised Joseph that she would marry him} had been publicly promised to marry Joseph. Before they began to sleep together, <char style="add">Mary</char> realized that she was pregnant. <char style="add">It was the power of</char> the Holy Spirit that had caused her to become pregnant. <verse number="19" style="v" />Joseph, her <char style="add">future</char> husband, was a man who obeyed God's commands. <char style="add">One of those commands was that men must divorce women who had acted immorally. So when Joseph learned that Mary was pregnant, he assumed that she was pregnant as a result of her acting immorally</char>. So he decided to break the engagement. But because he did not want to shame her publicly, he decided to do it privately. <verse number="20" style="v" />While he was seriously considering this, much to his surprise, in a dream he saw an angel whom the Lord <char style="add">sent</char>. The angel said, “Joseph, descendant of <char style="add">King</char> David, do not be afraid that <char style="add">you(sg) would be doing wrong if you(sg) would marry</char> Mary. Instead, <char style="add">begin to treat her</char> as your wife, because the Holy Spirit, <char style="add">not a man</char>, has caused her to be pregnant. <verse number="21" style="v" />She will give birth to a son. Since it is he who will cause that his people will be saved from <char style="add">the guilt of</char> their having sinned, name <char style="add">the baby</char> Jesus, <char style="add">which means ‘the Lord saves people’</char>.” <verse number="22" style="v" />All this happened as a result of what the Lord told the prophet <char style="add">Isaiah to write long ago about what was going to happen</char>. This is what Isaiah wrote: <verse number="23" style="v" />“Listen, a virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son. They will call him Emmanuel.” Emmanuel means ❛God is with us❜. <verse number="24" style="v" />When Joseph got up from sleep, he did what the angel whom the Lord <char style="add">had sent</char> commanded him to do. He took <char style="add">Mary</char> home to be his wife. <verse number="25" style="v" />But he did not have sexual relations with her until she had given birth to a son. And <char style="add">Joseph</char> named him Jesus.</para>
