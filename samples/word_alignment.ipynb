Machine uses the [Thot](https://github.com/sillsdev/thot) library to implement word alignment models. The classes can be enabled by installing the `sil-machine` package with the `thot` optional dependency."

Manually created alignments are not necessary. So let's create a parallel corpus from the source and target monolingual corpora."

First, we will demonstrate training a model from a class that inherits from `WordAlignmentModel`. We use the `create_trainer` method to create a trainer object that is used to train the model. If we do not specify a file path when creating the model object, then the model will only exist in memory. When we call the `save` method, the model instance is updated with the trained model parameters, but the model is not written to disk. We need to preprocess the corpus before training. First, we need to tokenize the corpus. We will also lowercase the data, since that generally gives better results."

They are not capable of modeling many-to-many alignments, which can occur in some language pairs. One way to get around this limitation is to train models in both directions (source-to-target and target-to-source), and then merge the resulting alignments from the two models into a single alignment. This is called symmetrization and is a common practice when using statistical word alignment models. In addition, researchers have found that symmetrized alignments are better quality."
