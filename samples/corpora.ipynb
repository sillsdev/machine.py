The sequence of verses is aligned to a canonical list of books, chapters, and verses. This canonical verse list is based on the Original versification. The [vref.txt](https://github.com/BibleNLP/ebible/blob/main/metadata/vref.txt) contains the list of verse references that align to this sequence. If a corpus contains verse ranges, then all of the text in the verse range will be found on the line corresponding to the first verse. The remaining verses will be marked with the special \"&lt;range&gt;\" token.\n",
